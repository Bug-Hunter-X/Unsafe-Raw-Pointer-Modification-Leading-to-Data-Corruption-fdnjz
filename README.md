This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that uses a raw pointer to modify a vector's element.  Because of how Rust manages memory, the direct manipulation via the pointer doesn't update the vector properly, and this can lead to unexpected and potentially dangerous behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` shows how to handle this kind of operation safely using Rust's built-in methods that preserve data integrity.
